This is the code to run the main program

    The algorithm given by:

    /* 1. Input is an un-directed graph, power parameter e, and inflation parameter r. */
    Done by Defining Class Object Graph and adding power parameter and inflation as input

    /* 2. Create the associated matrix */

    /* 3. Add self loops to each node (optional)*/

    /* 4. Normalize the Matrix */

    /* 5. Expand by taking the e-th power of the matrix */

    /* 6. Inflate by taking inflation of the resulting matrix with parameter r */

    /* 7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until a steady state is reached (convergence) */

    /* (Optional) 8. Iterpret resulting matrix to discover clusters */
